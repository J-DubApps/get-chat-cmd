The script **`ai_powershell_commands.ps1`** in this repo contains my own PowerShell functions I use for stating plain English requests to a chosen AI-LLM --> outputting a generated PS command -- to evaluate for use. The LLM outputs to console & copies output to the clipboard. In the gif animation above I am asking 3 popular AI models for code using basic plain-English requests.  **Requests should be short and goal/outcome-oriented**.  

***NOTE***: you **must** have *your own* API keys with all 3 AI providers to use the 3 main functions in `ai_powershell_commands.ps1`, as-written. You can *optionally* choose to leverage one function for a single preferred AI provider ***or***, if you host your own Chat models ***locally**: I provide a 4th function for use with locally-hosted models--via the optional `get-chat-local` func (for users of LM Studio, Ollama, etc). 

If you do not know how to locally-host an LLM or find major providers expensive, might I suggest [**Openrouter.ai**](https://openrouter.ai) which is a fantastic gateway to use [many different free and paid models](https://openrouter.ai/models).  

Also you can rename the functions however you'd like (I think "`get-ai-cmd`" was better but I'm too lazy to rename everything üòÇ).

These functions are intended for use in **PowerShell Core 7.5+** (they may work in 5.1, just haven't tested).  Engineers & Vibe-Coders alike, listen-up: see disclaimer here and in the license-agreement. This code is NOT tested in, or intended for, any prod environment.

## Functions

- `get-chat-cmd1`: Uses OpenRouter's API with the "openrouter/quasar-alpha" model
- `get-chat-cmd2`: Uses OpenAI's API with the "gpt-4o-mini" model
- `get-chat-cmd3`: Uses Anthropic's API with the "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219" model

## Setup

1. Edit `ai_powershell_commands.ps1` to replace:  <br />
‚Äî `YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY` with your actual OpenRouter API key  <br />
‚Äî `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY` with your actual OpenAI API key  <br />
‚Äî `YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_API_KEY` with your actual Anthropoic API key

   **Note**:   If you primarily only use, say,  Openrouter.ai as your API gateway: the OpenAI and Anthropic
               models can be called through "openrouter/model-name" as well.  You'd simply comment-out the
               "`get-chat-cmd2/3`" functions accordingly, and copy/use "`get-chat-cmd1`" for other Openrouter models.
               See [this link](https://openrouter.ai/models) for Openrouter models available.  

3. Import the functions into your current PowerShell session:

```powershell
. C:\Users\username\Desktop\ai_powershell_commands.ps1
```

## Usage

Simply call either function with your plain English request:

```powershell
# Using OpenRouter (quasar-alpha)
get-chat-cmd1 "List all running processes sorted by memory usage"

# Using OpenAI (gpt-4o-mini)
get-chat-cmd2 "Find files modified in the last 24 hours"

# Using Anthropic (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219)
get-chat-cmd3 "List all running processes"
```

These functions will:
1. Make an API call to the appropriate service
2. Display the resulting PowerShell command in colored text (without executing any code)
3. Copy the command to your clipboard for easy use

## Adding to Your PowerShell Profile

To make these functions available in all your PowerShell sessions, add the contents of `ai_powershell_commands.ps1` to your PowerShell profile:

1. Open your PowerShell profile in a text editor:

```powershell
notepad $PROFILE
```

2. Copy and paste the contents of `ai_powershell_commands.ps1` into your profile
3. Save the file and restart PowerShell 

Alternatively, you can add this line to your PowerShell profile to source the functions file:

```powershell
. "C:\Users\username\Desktop\ai_powershell_commands.ps1"
```
