The repo contains a script (**`ai_powershell_commands.ps1`**) with my PowerShell functions for: **generating PS commands from natural language using API calls to popular AI models, from within a PS session**. Generated PS commands are output to console for evaluation, and copied to the clipboard. In the gif animation above I am asking 3 popular AI models for code snippets, using basic plain-English requests.  **Requests should be short and goal/outcome-oriented**.  These PS functions are written for [PowerShell Core](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) on Windows, Linux/WSL2, or MacOS (they may work in 5.1, untested).  

I also maintain a variation of this same project for [**Bash**](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html) (tested in Ubuntu and MacOS) which can be found [***here***](https://github.com/J-DubApps/get_chat_cmd).

## Features

-   **Multiple AI Providers**: My PS Functions use OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, and locally-hosted models.
-   **Natural Language Input**: Describe the command you need in plain English.
-   **Clipboard Integration**: Automatically copies the generated command to your clipboard.
-   **Multi-platform**: Coded for PowerShell Core 7.5+, so it supports Windows, Linux, and MacOS (anywhere PS Core can deploy).

## Functions

- `get-chat-cmd1`: Uses OpenRouter's API with the "openrouter/quasar-alpha" model
- `get-chat-cmd2`: Uses OpenAI's API with the "gpt-4o-mini" model
- `get-chat-cmd3`: Uses Anthropic's API with the "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219" model
- `get-chat-local`: Optional function for calls to locally-hosted Chat models (only tested with LM Studio)

## Requirements / Limitations

***NOTE***: you **must** have *your own* API keys with all 3 AI providers to use the 3 main functions in `ai_powershell_commands.ps1`, as-written.  If you are new to using API calls in PowerShell, info on obtaining API keys is below. You can also choose to *only* use a single function with a preferred AI provider ***or*** your own ***locally-hosted*** Chat model (via `get-chat-local` func which supports LM Studio and Ollama). 

If you do not know how to locally-host your own Chat models and don't like the idea of giving "big AI" your money: might I suggest [**Openrouter.ai**](https://openrouter.ai) which is a fantastic gateway for [many different free and paid models](https://openrouter.ai/models), and their pricing for "big AI models" is usually resonable.

These functions are intended for use in **PowerShell Core 7.5+** (they may work in 5.1, haven't tested). Engineers & Vibe-Coders listen-up: see disclaimer below or license-agreement. This code is NOT tested in, or intended for, any prod environment.

## Setup

1. Edit `ai_powershell_commands.ps1` to replace:  <br />
‚Äî `YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY` with your actual OpenRouter API key  <br />
‚Äî `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY` with your actual OpenAI API key  <br />
‚Äî `YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_API_KEY` with your actual Anthropoic API key

   **Note**:   If you primarily only use, say,  Openrouter.ai as your API gateway: the OpenAI and Anthropic
               models can be called through "openrouter/model-name" as well.  You'd simply comment-out the
               "`get-chat-cmd2/3`" functions accordingly, and copy/use "`get-chat-cmd1`" for other Openrouter-proxied models.
               See [this link](https://openrouter.ai/models) for Openrouter models available.
               No API key is required for the optional "`get-chat-local`" function but your *locally-hosted* model must be accepting API requests.

3. Import the functions into your current PowerShell session:

```powershell
. C:\Users\username\Desktop\ai_powershell_commands.ps1
```

## Usage

Simply call either function with your plain English request:

```powershell
# Using OpenRouter (quasar-alpha)
get-chat-cmd1 "List all running processes sorted by memory usage"

# Using OpenAI (gpt-4o-mini)
get-chat-cmd2 "Find files modified in the last 24 hours"

# Using Anthropic (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219)
get-chat-cmd3 "List all running processes"
```

These functions will:
1. Make an API call to the appropriate service
2. Display the resulting PowerShell command in colored text (without executing any code)
3. Copy the command to your clipboard for easy use

### More Examples:

```powershell
get-chat-cmd2 "Find all .csv files created in the past 12 hours"  # directs request to ChatGPT 4o and returns:
```

> ```Get-ChildItem -Path . -Filter *.csv | Where-Object { $_.CreationTime -ge (Get-Date).AddHours(-12) }```

```powershell
get-chat-cmd3 "return the current time in UTC format"   # directs request to Claude 3.7 and returns:
```
> ```Get-Date -UFormat "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC"```

### If using the optional ```get-chat-```***```local```*** function (to interact with a locally-running LLM), you have use additional parameters:

#### Basic get-chat-local usage with defaults
```powershell
get-chat-local "List all processes using more than 100MB of memory"
```
#### Custom endpoint if using different port
```powershell
get-chat-local -prompt "Find all .log files modified in the last 24 hours" -endpoint "http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions"
```
#### Specify model name and adjust temperature
```powershell
get-chat-local -prompt "Create a script to backup my Documents folder" -model "llama3-8b" -temperature 0.2
```

## Adding to Your PowerShell Profile

To make these functions available in all your PowerShell sessions, add the contents of `ai_powershell_commands.ps1` to your PowerShell profile:

1. Open your PowerShell profile in a text editor:

```powershell
notepad $PROFILE
```

2. Copy and paste the contents of `ai_powershell_commands.ps1` into your profile
3. Save the file and restart PowerShell 

Alternatively, you can add this line to your PowerShell profile to source the functions file:

```powershell
. "C:\Users\username\Desktop\ai_powershell_commands.ps1"
```

Also you can rename the functions however you'd like (I think "`get-ai-cmd`" was better but I am too lazy to rename everything üòÇ).
