This repo contains my PowerShell functions that I use for stating plain English requests to your chosen AI-LLM, and receiving back a PS command.  LLM outputs a PS command for review in console + copies the command to clipboard. **NOTE**: You **must** have *your own* API key from *at least one* of the 3 included AI Service Providers in order to minimally use *any one* of the 3 functions in `ai_powershell_commands.ps1`.  It is not expensive to maintain 3 API keys for these providers (and Openrouter is a gateway to multiple popular AI models).  

These functions have only been tested in **PowerShell Core 7.5** (they may work in 5.1, just haven't tested).  
Also you can rename the functions to anything you want (I think "`get-ai-cmd`" is better, but I'm too lazy to rename everything üòÇ).

## Functions

- `get-chat-cmd1`: Uses OpenRouter's API with the "openrouter/quasar-alpha" model
- `get-chat-cmd2`: Uses OpenAI's API with the "gpt-4o-mini" model
- `get-chat-cmd3`: Uses Anthropic's API with the "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219" model

## Setup

1. Edit `ai_powershell_commands.ps1` to replace:  <br />
‚Äî `YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY` with your actual OpenRouter API key  <br />
‚Äî `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY` with your actual OpenAI API key  <br />
‚Äî `YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_API_KEY` with your actual Anthropoic API key

   **Note**:   If you primarily only use, say,  Openrouter.ai as your API gateway: the OpenAI and Anthropic
               models can be called through "openrouter/model-name" as well.  You'd simply comment-out the
               "`get-chat-cmd2/3`" functions accordingly, and copy/use "`get-chat-cmd1`" for other Openrouter models.
               See [this link](https://openrouter.ai/models) for Openrouter models available.  

3. Import the functions into your current PowerShell session:

```powershell
. C:\Users\username\Desktop\ai_powershell_commands.ps1
```

## Usage

Simply call either function with your plain English request:

```powershell
# Using OpenRouter (quasar-alpha)
get-chat-cmd1 "List all running processes sorted by memory usage"

# Using OpenAI (gpt-4o-mini)
get-chat-cmd2 "Find files modified in the last 24 hours"

# Using Anthropic (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219)
get-chat-cmd3 "List all running processes"
```

These functions will:
1. Make an API call to the appropriate service
2. Display the resulting PowerShell command in colored text (without executing any code)
3. Copy the command to your clipboard for easy use

## Adding to Your PowerShell Profile

To make these functions available in all your PowerShell sessions, add the contents of `ai_powershell_commands.ps1` to your PowerShell profile:

1. Open your PowerShell profile in a text editor:

```powershell
notepad $PROFILE
```

2. Copy and paste the contents of `ai_powershell_commands.ps1` into your profile
3. Save the file and restart PowerShell 

Alternatively, you can add this line to your PowerShell profile to source the functions file:

```powershell
. "C:\Users\username\Desktop\ai_powershell_commands.ps1"
```
